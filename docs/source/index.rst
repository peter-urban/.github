Welcome to themachinethatgoesping's documentation!
===================================

**themachinethatgoesping** (tmtgp or ping..!) is about to become a set Python libraries for enabling advanced processing strategies for multibeam and singlebeam echosounder data. <br>
Core components of this library will implemented in C++ and interfaces using pybind11. <br>
The functionality of the components can thus also be accessed using the C++libraries directly. <br>
However, some libraries, and many tools and applications will be implemented in Python directly, making use of the fast prototyping features of this language. <br>

Most of the libraries will be released sing the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0) which implements a non-infecting copyleft on file basis. It is thus compatible with proprietary applications, with GPL >2.0 but also MIT and BSD projects (if the license of the files is not changes). More detailed information will follow soon.

We just started, and serious development will not happen before the end of may 2022.

But if you are interested, just contact peter.urban@ugent.be

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information (future)
how to :ref:`installation` the project (future).
