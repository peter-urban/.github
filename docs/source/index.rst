Welcome to themachinethatgoesping's documentation!
===================================

**themachinethatgoesping** (tmtgp or ping..!) is about to become a set Python library for enabling advanced processing strategies for multibeam and singlebeam echosounder data.
Core components of this library will implemented in C++ and interfaces using pybind11.
The functionality of the components can thus also be accessed using the C++libraries directly.
However, some libraries, and many tools and applications will be implemented in Python directly, making use of the fast prototyping features of this language.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information (future)
how to :ref:`installation` the project (future).
