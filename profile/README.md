## Hi there 👋
This is themachinethatgoesping (or tmtgp or ping..!). A project to enable advanced processing for multibeam and singlebeam echosounder data. For method developers and everyday users<br>
Core libraries in this project will be implemented in C++ and exposed to python using pybind11. <br>
These components can also be accessed via the C++ libraries directly. <br>
But many libraries/tools/applications will be implemented in Python directly, making use of the fast prototyping capabilities and powerfull existing math libraries of this language.

Most of this librarie will be released sing the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0) which in simple terms implements a non-infecting copyleft on file basis. It is thus compatible with proprietary applications, with GPL >2.0 but also MIT and BSD projects (if the license of the files is not changes). More detailed information will follow soon.

We just started, and serious development will not happen before the end of may 2022.

But if you are interested, just contact peter.urban@ugent.be
